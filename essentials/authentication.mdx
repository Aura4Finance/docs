description: "Authenticate requests to the Orafi API using API keys."
---

All requests to the Orafi API must include a valid API key in the `x-api-key` header. Your API key identifies your business and determines whether requests run in **test** or **live** mode.

---

## API key format

| Environment | Prefix | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Test | `ora_test_` | `ora_test_a1b2c3d4e5f6...` |
| Live | `ora_live_` | `ora_live_x9y8z7w6v5u4...` |

Both test and live keys are 32+ characters and available in your [Dashboard](https://dashboard.orafi.app).

## Making authenticated requests

Include your API key in the `x-api-key` header on every request:

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl -X GET https://api.orafi.app/transactions \
  -H "x-api-key: ora_test_your_api_key"
```

```javascript Node.js
const response = await fetch("https://api.orafi.app/transactions", {
  headers: {
    "x-api-key": "ora_test_your_api_key"
  }
});
```

```python Python
import requests

response = requests.get(
    "https://api.orafi.app/transactions",
    headers={"x-api-key": "ora_test_your_api_key"}
)
```

</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
  Requests without a valid `x-api-key` header return a **401 Unauthorized** error.
</Warning>

## Test vs live mode

Your API key controls which mode you operate in. Both modes use the same base URL (`https://api.orafi.app`), so there's no environment-specific endpoint to remember.

| Feature | Test mode | Live mode |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Real funds | No (testnet) | Yes (mainnet) |
| Webhooks | Delivered normally | Delivered normally |
| Onboarding required | No | Yes |
| API key prefix | `ora_test_` | `ora_live_` |

<Tip>
  Always develop and test your integration using test-mode keys first. Switch to live keys only after your integration is verified.
</Tip>

## Keeping keys secure

- **Never** expose API keys in client-side code, mobile apps, or public repositories.
- Store keys in environment variables or a secrets manager.
- Rotate keys immediately if you suspect they have been compromised.
- Use test keys for all development and CI/CD pipelines.
