description: "Understand Orafi's transparent, on-chain fee model for payments, payouts, and refunds."
---

Orafi uses a simple **1% platform fee** that is enforced at the smart-contract level. Fees are deducted automatically before settlement --- no manual calculations required.

---

## Fee overview

| Transaction type | Fee | Deducted from | On-chain |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Payment** | 1% | Payment amount | Yes |
| **Payout** | 1% | Payout amount | Yes |
| **Refund** | Free | --- | --- |

<Info>
  All fees are computed using **basis-point integer arithmetic** for precision. Fee transfers happen **atomically** within the same on-chain transaction as the payment or payout.

## Payment fees

When a customer pays, Orafi automatically:

1. Validates the incoming amount.
2. Calculates the 1% platform fee.
3. Transfers the fee to the Orafi platform wallet.
4. Settles the remaining 99% to the merchant.

**Example:**

| Payment amount | Platform fee (1%) | Merchant receives |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1,000 USDC | 10 USDC | 990 USDC |
| 500 USDC | 5 USDC | 495 USDC |
| 50 USDC | 0.50 USDC | 49.50 USDC |

---

## Payout fees

When a merchant withdraws funds, the same 1% fee applies:

1. The platform validates available balance.
2. Calculates and deducts the 1% fee.
3. Transfers the remaining amount to the destination wallet.

**Example:**

| Payout amount | Platform fee (1%) | Merchant receives |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 500 USDC | 5 USDC | 495 USDC |
| 100 USDC | 1 USDC | 99 USDC |

---

## Refund fees

**Refunds are free.** The full refunded amount is returned to the customer with no platform fee deducted. This ensures fair reimbursement and avoids double-charging.

---

## Key details

- Only **USDC** is currently supported as a settlement token.
- Fee changes require a **protocol-level update** and will be announced publicly before taking effect.
- All fee logic is **transparent and deterministic** --- you can verify it on-chain.
