## How it works

Orafi sits between your application and the blockchain. When a customer initiates a payment:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a payment">
    Your server calls the Orafi API to create a payment with the amount, customer details, and a transaction reference.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Customer pays">
    Orafi generates a unique deposit address and a hosted checkout URL. The customer can transfer crypto directly or sign a transaction with their wallet.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Payment confirmed">
    Orafi verifies the on-chain transaction, settles funds to your account (minus a 1% platform fee), and sends a webhook to your server.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Funds available">
    Withdraw settled funds at any time via crypto or fiat payout endpoints.
  </Step>
</Steps>
