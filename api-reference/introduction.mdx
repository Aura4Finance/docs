---

The Orafi API is organized around [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST). It accepts JSON-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP status codes and verbs.

---

## Base URL

```
https://api.orafi.app
```

Both test and live requests use the same base URL. Your API key determines the mode.

---

## Authentication

Authenticate every request by including your API key in the `x-api-key` header:

```bash
curl https://api.orafi.app/transactions \
  -H "x-api-key: ora_test_your_api_key"
```

See the [Authentication guide](/essentials/authentication) for details on key formats and security best practices.

---

## Request & response format

All request bodies must be `application/json` (except file uploads which use `multipart/form-data`).

Every response follows a consistent envelope:

<CodeGroup>

```json Success
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Operation successful",
  "data": { ... }
}
```

```json Error
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "A human-readable error description"
}
```

</CodeGroup>

## HTTP status codes

| Code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `200` | Request succeeded |
| `201` | Resource created |
| `400` | Bad request — invalid parameters |
| `401` | Unauthorized — missing or invalid API key |
| `403` | Forbidden — insufficient permissions |
| `404` | Not found — resource doesn't exist |
| `429` | Too many requests — rate limited |
| `500` | Internal server error |

---

## Rate limiting

API requests are rate-limited. Inspect these response headers to monitor your usage:

| Header | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `X-RateLimit-Limit` | Max requests per window |
| `X-RateLimit-Remaining` | Requests remaining |
| `X-RateLimit-Reset` | Time when the window resets |

If you hit the limit, back off and retry after `X-RateLimit-Reset`.

---

## Pagination

List endpoints use **cursor-based pagination** for consistent performance:

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `limit` | `number` | Max items per page (default `20`) |
| `cursor` | `string` | Cursor from a previous response to fetch the next page |

Response includes `nextCursor` and `hasNextPage` to indicate whether more data is available.
